1 How do you obtain the currently executing task handle?
Use xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle().
It takes no arguments and provides the current task’s handle as the return value.

2 How do you give up the CPU to another task?
Call taskYIELD().
Tells the task scheduler that you have nothing further to do and that you want to hand over the CPU to another worthy task.

3 Which CPU core do application programs execute on for the ESP32?
Application programs run on CPU1, the second core according to table 2-3 at page 37.

4 What is the name of the default task provided by the Arduino environment?
The task named loopTask is the main Arduino task, which calls functions setup() and loop().

5 What FreeRTOS function is used to suspend one task?
Use vTaskSuspend(). This stops the task until it is resumed with vTaskResume()

6 Can a task delete itself and if so how?
Yes, a task can delete itself by calling vTaskDelete().

7 When is the task’s stack released when a task deletes itself? Immediately or later dur-
ing the IDLE task?
A task that deletes itself defers the release of its stack until the IDLE task can process 
the request. It is released later by the IDLE task.


8 What causes the preemption in FreeRTOS for ESP32?
The preemption occurs with the system tick interrupt.

9 How often do the ESP32 tick interrupts occur?
The ESP32 tick interrupts occur 1 millisecond apart.
